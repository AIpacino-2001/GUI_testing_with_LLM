*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid (The task is known to be completed when the data from AnkiWeb is successfully synced to AnkiDroid)

I'm currently on the Introduction page. I plan to touch the "Sync from AnkiWeb" button to transfer the data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid for synchronization. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Sync from AnkiWeb"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Sync from AnkiWeb" button, the user is taken to the login screen where they can enter their AnkiWeb account details to sync their data. (page changed from Introduction to Login). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: Login,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 8,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: Navigate up,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: AnkiWeb account
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: Email address,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 21,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: Password,
      is_password: true,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 24,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: Show password,
      resource_id: text_input_end_icon,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 28,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Reset password,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Note: AnkiWeb is not affiliated with AnkiDroid
    },
    {
      ID: 30,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Privacy,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 31,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Forgot Email?,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Touched the "Sync from AnkiWeb" button on the Introduction page, which led to the Login page where AnkiWeb account details can be entered.
2. Description of the current app state: The user is on the Login page where they can input their AnkiWeb account details for synchronization.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: The next step involves filling in the Email address and Password fields to proceed with the synchronization process.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to fill in the Email address and Password fields to provide the AnkiWeb account details required for synchronization.

*** Assistant:
Role of the textfield: The textfield is for entering the AnkiWeb account email address.
Reasoning for generating fufu's text: fufu should input their AnkiWeb account email address for synchronization.
