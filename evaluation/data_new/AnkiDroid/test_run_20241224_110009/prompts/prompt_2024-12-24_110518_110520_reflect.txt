Guideline for the task reflection based on the task result:
- If the task is successful, provide a learned knowledge about the app functionality. (e.g., "The app supports the task X by doing Y.")
- If the task is failed and seems to be impossible to accomplish (e.g., the app does not support the task), reflect on the reason why the task is impossible to accomplish. (e.g., "fufu once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that the app does not support Z.")
- If the task is failed but still seems to be possible to accomplish, reflect why fufu failed to accomplish the task and provide lessons learned from the failure. (e.g., "fufu once tried to do X but couldn't do Y. It seems that fufu might have to do Z before doing Y.")
- The reflections will be provided to fufu to help planning next tasks and avoid previous mistakes. Keep the reflections to be self-contained (briefly include what the target task was) and concise.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your answer step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

Reflections on the task:
- Navigating through the app's pages can be achieved by utilizing the buttons and search functionalities effectively.
- It's important to pay attention to the changes in buttons and elements on the page to understand the current context.
- Knowing when to stop and switch to a more achievable task is a wise decision to maintain productivity and focus.
