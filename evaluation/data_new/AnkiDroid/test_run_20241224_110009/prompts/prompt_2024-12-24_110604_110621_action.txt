*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the DeckPicker page to understand available deck options. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has interacted with different deck options on the DeckPicker page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. I plan to touch the "Home" button to view and select different decks on the DeckPicker page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Home"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Deck Search"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a focused textfield that has text "Search using deck name" with "Computer Science Flashcards"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Clear query"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Clear query" button, the text in the focused text field changed from "Computer Science Flashcards" to "Search using deck name," allowing the user to easily input a new search query. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: Collapse,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 4,
      widget_role_inference: The widget facilitates collapsing a section or menu and navigating up within the current page.
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: Search using deck name,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 6,
      widget_role_inference: The widget serves as a textfield for searching decks on the SharedDecks screen, allowing users to input search queries and providing a Clear query button for easy query removal.
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: Home,
      resource_id: home,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 14,
      widget_role_inference: The widget Home button opens a focused scrollable area in the SharedDecks screen.
    },
    {
      ID: 18,
      widget_type: WebView,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        scroll
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 4
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the DeckPicker page to understand available deck options.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched the "Home" button, filled in the search text field with "Computer Science Flashcards," and cleared the search query on the SharedDecks page.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page is the SharedDecks page with options to collapse a section, search for decks, go back home, and scroll within a WebView.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Explore the available deck options by interacting with the scrollable WebView to view different decks.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The most logical action is to scroll on the WebView to explore different deck options on the DeckPicker page.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
