*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the DeckPicker page to understand available deck options. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has interacted with different deck options on the DeckPicker page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Home"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Deck Search"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a focused textfield that has text "Search using deck name" with "Computer Science Flashcards"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Clear query"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Scroll down on a focused scrollable area

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu so far seem okay in exploring the DeckPicker page, but there hasn't been direct interaction with different deck options yet. fufu needs to explore the available deck options by interacting with them directly on the DeckPicker page to understand the variety of decks offered." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: Collapse,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 4,
      widget_role_inference: The widget allows users to collapse a section, swapping the Collapse button with a Navigate up button, and replacing the textfield with a Download deck textview.
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: Search using deck name,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 6,
      widget_role_inference: The widget functions as a search textfield on the SharedDecks screen, allowing users to enter and display search queries, with the ability to clear the entered query using the Clear query button.
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: Home,
      resource_id: home,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 14,
      widget_role_inference: The widget Home button navigates to a focused scrollable area in the SharedDecks screen.
    },
    {
      ID: 18,
      widget_type: WebView,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        scroll
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 6
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the DeckPicker page to understand available deck options.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: fufu has interacted with the Collapse button, performed a search using the search textfield, and cleared the query on the SharedDecks page.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page is the SharedDecks page with options to collapse sections, search for decks using a textfield, and navigate to the home screen.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To interact directly with different deck options, fufu should explore the available deck options by scrolling through the focused scrollable area.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The most logical action is to scroll through the focused scrollable area to explore and interact with different deck options on the DeckPicker page.
