Task execution history so far (listed in chronological order):
===
11:00:35:Introduction: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has text "Sync from AnkiWeb"
11:00:40:Login: [OBSERVATION] By touching the "Sync from AnkiWeb" button, the user is taken to the login screen where they can enter their AnkiWeb account details to sync their data. (page changed from Introduction to Login)
11:00:48:Login: [ACTION] fufu filled a textfield that has text "Email address" with the text "2797195863@qq.com"
11:00:53:Login: [OBSERVATION] The textfield with the placeholder "Email address" has been focused and filled with the email address "2797195863@qq.com". A new button with the content description "Clear text" has appeared on the screen.
11:01:00:Login: [ACTION] fufu filled a password textfield that has text "Password" with the text "20080808"
11:01:05:Login: [OBSERVATION] The password textfield on the login screen has been successfully filled with the new password "20080808", replacing the previous placeholder text "Password".
11:01:15:Login: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has text "Log in"
11:01:20:DeckPicker: [OBSERVATION] After touching the "Log in" button, the screen has transitioned from the Login page to the DeckPicker page, where a message about the outdated system WebView is displayed along with an option to "Learn More." (page changed from Login to DeckPicker)
11:01:29:DeckPicker: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has text "Learn More"
11:01:34:DeckPicker: [OBSERVATION] After touching the "Learn More" button, the screen transitioned to a new page with options to either cancel or replace the current collection with a collection from AnkiDroid. Additionally, a popup message briefly appeared asking which collection to keep.
===

Current page: DeckPicker 
Widgets in current page:
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Replace collection
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Replace your collection on AnkiWeb with your collection from AnkiDroid?
    },
    {
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Cancel,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Replace,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```
Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your choice step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.
