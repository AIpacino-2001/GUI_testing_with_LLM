*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid (The task is known to be completed when the data from AnkiWeb is successfully synced to AnkiDroid)

I'm currently on the Introduction page. I plan to touch the "Sync from AnkiWeb" button to transfer the data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid for synchronization. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Sync from AnkiWeb"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to Login. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a textfield that has text "Email address" with "2797195863@qq.com"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a password textfield that has text "Password" with "20080808"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the password textfield on the login screen has been successfully filled with the new password "20080808", replacing the previous placeholder text "Password". What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: Login,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 8,
      widget_type: ImageButton,

      widget_role_inference: The widget serves as a password textfield on the login screen, allowing users to enter their password, with the current text displayed being 20080808.

    {
      ID: 30,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Log in,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch

      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Note: AnkiWeb is not affiliated with AnkiDroid
    },
    {
      ID: 33,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Privacy,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 34,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Forgot Email?,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have successfully filled in the email address and password textfields on the Login screen.
2. Description of the current app state: The Login screen contains textfields for email address and password, along with options to clear text, show password, log in, reset password, and access privacy and account recovery options.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: The next step might involve tapping on the "Log in" button to proceed with the authentication process for syncing data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The most logical action is to tap on the "Log in" button to authenticate and initiate the data sync process.
