*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid (The task is known to be completed when the data from AnkiWeb is successfully synced to AnkiDroid)

I'm currently on the Introduction page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Sync from AnkiWeb"

*** User:

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "fab_main"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu seem to be following the flow of the app, but there seems to be a loop of interacting with the "Learn More" button without progressing towards syncing data from AnkiWeb. fufu needs to explore the "Get shared decks" option to initiate the process of syncing data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Get shared decks"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from DeckPicker to SharedDecks. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Home"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Scroll down on a focused scrollable area

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: Navigate up,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Download deck
    },
    {
      ID: 12,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: Home,
      resource_id: home,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget provides access to a focused scrollable area in the SharedDecks screen when touched.
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: Deck Search,
      resource_id: search,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 15,
      widget_type: WebView,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        scroll
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Explored the "Get shared decks" option, scrolled down on a focused scrollable area in SharedDecks.

2. Description of the current app state: In the SharedDecks page, with options to navigate up, download a deck, go home, search for decks, and a scrollable WebView.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Since the task is to sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid, the next step might involve selecting or downloading a specific deck from the SharedDecks to initiate the sync process.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The logical next action would be to download a specific deck by interacting with the "Download deck" option to start the data sync process from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
