*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Navigate to the DeckPicker page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully lands on the DeckPicker page)

Scroll down on a focused scrollable area

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "<1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>. <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Home"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a focused textfield that has text "Search using deck name"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "Collapse"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the "Collapse" button was swapped with a "Navigate up" button, and the textfield was replaced with a "Download deck" textview. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: Navigate up,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Download deck
    },
    {
      ID: 12,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: Home,
      resource_id: home,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 10,
      widget_role_inference: The widget Home button navigates to a focused scrollable area in the SharedDecks screen.
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: Deck Search,
      resource_id: search,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 6,
      widget_role_inference: The widget Deck Search button activates a search functionality, displaying a focused text field for searching by deck name and replacing itself with a Collapse button.
    },
    {
      ID: 15,
      widget_type: WebView,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        scroll
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 4
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Navigate to the DeckPicker page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched on the "Collapse" button which was then swapped with the "Navigate up" button, and interacted with the textfield for searching by deck name.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page "SharedDecks" includes a "Navigate up" button, a "Download deck" textview, a "Home" button, a "Deck Search" button, and a focused scrollable area.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Explore the "Download deck" textview to understand its functionality and potential role in navigating to the DeckPicker page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: To progress towards the DeckPicker page, understanding the role of the "Download deck" textview may reveal a new pathway or action to take.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
