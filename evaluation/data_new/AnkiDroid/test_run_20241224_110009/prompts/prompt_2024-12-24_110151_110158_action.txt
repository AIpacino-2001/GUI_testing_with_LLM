*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid (The task is known to be completed when the data from AnkiWeb is successfully synced to AnkiDroid)

I'm currently on the Introduction page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Sync from AnkiWeb"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to Login. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a textfield that has text "Email address" with "2797195863@qq.com"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Fill a password textfield that has text "Password" with "20080808"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Log in"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Login to DeckPicker. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Learn More"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "<The actions taken so far seem okay.>. <none>." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Replace"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Learn More"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Learn More" button on the DeckPicker screen, the screen transitioned to the CustomTab screen where the button text changed to "Skip to content" and additional navigation buttons and widgets were added. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated to the CustomTab screen by touching the "Learn More" button on the DeckPicker screen.

2. Description of the current app state: The current page is the CustomTab screen with a WebView displaying information about WebView Detection and Package Updates on GitHub. There are navigation buttons and widgets available on the screen.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Since the task is to sync data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid, the current content on the CustomTab screen seems unrelated to the synchronization process. It might be necessary to navigate to a different section related to syncing data.

4. Reasoning for the next action: It is recommended to explore a new widget or button related to syncing data or AnkiWeb integration to progress towards completing the synchronization task.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
