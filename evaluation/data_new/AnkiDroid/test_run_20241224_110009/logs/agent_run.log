GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:02:14,421: * Critique during a task: The actions taken by fufu seem to be following the flow of the app, but there seems to be a loop of interacting with the "Learn More" button without progressing towards syncing data from AnkiWeb.
GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:02:14,422: * Suggested workaround: fufu needs to explore the "Get shared decks" option to initiate the process of syncing data from AnkiWeb to AnkiDroid.
GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:03:45,072: * Critique during a task: The actions taken so far have focused on the "Deck Search" functionality and navigating back to the home page, but there hasn't been direct progress towards reaching the DeckPicker page.
GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:03:45,072: * Suggested workaround: fufu needs to interact with the "Collapse" button to potentially reveal more options leading to the DeckPicker page.

GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:06:32,073: * Critique during a task: The actions taken by fufu so far seem okay in exploring the DeckPicker page, but there hasn't been direct interaction with different deck options yet.
GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:06:32,073: * Suggested workaround: fufu needs to explore the available deck options by interacting with them directly on the DeckPicker page to understand the variety of decks offered.
GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:07:34,508: * Critique during a task: The actions taken by fufu are mostly okay, but they have interacted with the "Computer Science Flashcards" deck, which is empty, and have been prompted to add flashcards.
GTestAgent._actor:INFO - 2024-12-24 11:07:34,508: * Suggested workaround: fufu needs to explore other available deck options on the DeckPicker page to understand the different decks available.
