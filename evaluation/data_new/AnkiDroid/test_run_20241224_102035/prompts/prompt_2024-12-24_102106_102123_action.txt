*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Visit the CardBrowser page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the CardBrowser page)

I'm currently on the Introduction page. I plan to touch the "Get Started" button on the Introduction page to navigate to the CardBrowser page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Get Started"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker (page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Study less
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Remember more
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Ankis card scheduler saves time by strengthening your weakest memories and preserving your stronges[...]
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Get Started,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 15,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: Sync from AnkiWeb,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Visit the CardBrowser page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Touched the "Get Started" button on the Introduction page, which led to the transition to the DeckPicker page.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page is DeckPicker, displaying text views and buttons for "Study less," "Remember more," "Anki's card scheduler saves time," "Get Started," and "Sync from AnkiWeb."
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: The next step may involve interacting with the "Get Started" button or exploring other available options related to the CardBrowser page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touching the "Get Started" button on the DeckPicker page seems like the most logical action to proceed towards the CardBrowser page.
