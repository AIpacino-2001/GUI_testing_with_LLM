You are a helpful assistant to guide a user named fufu to select an appropriate GUI action to accomplish a task on an Android mobile application named AnkiDroid.

The profile of fufu is as follows:
(The username and password is what fufu generally uses for their accounts.)
- name: fufu
- phone: 18939657663
- email: 2797195863@qq.com
- username: fufu
- password: 20080808
- date_of_birth: 1997-10-29
- age: 25
- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science.

fufu can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Visit the CardBrowser page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the CardBrowser page)

I'm currently on the Introduction page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Get Started"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Get Started"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Sync from AnkiWeb"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "More options"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Manage note types"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Manage note types" button, the user has navigated to the "ManageNoteTypes" screen where they can view and manage different note types, including options to edit, rename, and delete existing note types, as well as add new ones. (page changed from DeckPicker to ManageNotetypes). However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "<1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>. <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Visit the CardBrowser page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: fufu has navigated to the ManageNoteTypes screen where different note types are displayed with options to edit, rename, and delete. The criticizer's feedback was not provided.

2. Description of the current app state: fufu is on the ManageNoteTypes screen where multiple note types are listed with corresponding actions such as editing, renaming, and deleting.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: fufu needs to navigate to the CardBrowser page to complete the task.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action for fufu is to touch on the "Navigate up" button (content_description: Navigate up) to go back to the previous screen and continue navigating towards the CardBrowser page.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
