*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named 知乎 to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the "热榜" section to view popular content. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has scrolled through the list of hot topics and engaged with at least one of the trending topics)

I'm currently on the Main page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "热榜"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "跳过"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "科学"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu have deviated from the main task of exploring the "热榜" section to view popular content. fufu needs to explore the "热榜" section by directly interacting with the widget labeled "热榜" to view popular content." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "科学"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "跳过2, 翻转手机, 前往淘宝双12狂欢节[...and more]"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button labeled "跳过2," the text on the button changed to "跳过5," and the textview with "前往淘宝双12狂欢节" was replaced with "去京东一探究竟." Additionally, the textview with "Tanx" was replaced with "JD" on the Launcher screen. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: Launcher,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 6,
      widget_type: RelativeLayout,
      resource_id: launch_layout,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0,
      children: [
        {
          ID: 9,
          widget_type: RelativeLayout,
          resource_id: launch_ad_layout,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 0,
          children: [
            {
              ID: 17,
              widget_type: TextView,
              text: 跳过5,
              possible_action_types: [
                touch
              ],
              num_prev_actions: 0
            },
            {
              widget_type: TextView,
              text: 翻转手机
            },
            {
              widget_type: TextView,
              text: 去京东一探究竟
            },
            {
              widget_type: TextView,
              text: JD
            },
            {
              widget_type: TextView,
              text: 广告
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the "热榜" section to view popular content.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched on the button labeled "跳过5" and observed text changes on other widgets.
2. Description of the current app state: The Launcher screen shows a widget with a textview "跳过5" and other textviews with various content like "翻转手机" and "去京东一探究竟."
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: The task of exploring the "热榜" section has not been progressed due to the distractions caused by the changing texts. It's essential to refocus on the main task.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touch on the widget with the text "跳过5" to proceed and refocus on exploring the "热榜" section.
