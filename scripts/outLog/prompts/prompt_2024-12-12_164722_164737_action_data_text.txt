*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the ManageSpace page)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "电话"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "开始"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "button"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "<1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>. <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "登录"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "登录" button, the user has navigated from the "DeckPicker" screen to the "MyAccount" screen where they can log in to their AnkiWeb account or create a new account. The screen now displays options for email and password entry, password reset, registration, and other account-related actions. (page changed from DeckPicker to MyAccount). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: MyAccount,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 8,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 转到上一层级,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: AnkiWeb 帐户
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: 电子邮件地址,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 21,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: 密码,
      is_password: true,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 24,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 显示密码,
      resource_id: text_input_end_icon,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 28,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 重置密码,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 还没有AnkiWeb账户吗？它是免费的！
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 注 ︰ AnkiWeb不属于AnkiDroid
    },
    {
      ID: 31,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 注册,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 32,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 隐私,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 33,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 忘了电子邮件地址吗？,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Navigated from the DeckPicker screen to the MyAccount screen by touching the "登录" button.
2. Description of the current app state: The user is on the MyAccount page where they can log in to their AnkiWeb account or create a new account. The page contains options for email and password entry, password reset, registration, and account-related actions.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: The user needs to log in or create an account to access the ManageSpace page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to fill in the email address and password to log in to the AnkiWeb account. Therefore, the user should set text for the email address widget.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.

*** Assistant:
Role of the textfield: The textfield is for inputting the email address.
Reasoning for generating fufu's text: fufu should input their own email address to log in to the AnkiWeb account.
