Task execution history so far (listed in chronological order):
===
16:44:24:None: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has text "电话"
16:45:15:Introduction: [OBSERVATION] By touching the button labeled "电话" on the previous screen, the current screen now displays new textviews with educational content and buttons for starting and syncing with AnkiWeb.
16:45:18:Introduction: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has text "开始"
16:46:04:Introduction: [ACTION] Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app
16:46:05:DeckPicker: [OBSERVATION] By touching the button with the text "开始," the user transitioned from the Introduction screen to the DeckPicker screen, where now there is a checked button for granting file management permissions and a new textview explaining the permission. (page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker)
16:46:08:DeckPicker: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button
16:46:32:DeckPicker: [OBSERVATION] By touching on the button labeled "打开侧栏" in the DeckPicker screen, the current screen now displays additional buttons with resource IDs "button" and "fab_main," and new text views prompting to add cards using the "+" icon.

16:46:59:DeckPicker: [OBSERVATION] The button with resource_id "button" was touched, leading to a change in the screen content, where the text "AnkiDroid" was replaced with "登录到AnkiWeb" and new buttons for "取消" and "登录" appeared.

Current page: DeckPicker 
Widgets in current page:
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 登录到AnkiWeb
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 您必须登录到第三方账户以使用云同步服务。您可以在下一步创建一个账户。
    },
    {
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 取消,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 登录,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```
Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your choice step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.
