*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the ManageSpace page)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. I plan to touch the "ManageSpace" option to discover more about managing space in the AnkiDroid app. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "电话"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "开始"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button with the text "开始," the user transitioned from the Introduction screen to the DeckPicker screen, where now there is a checked button for granting file management permissions and a new textview explaining the permission. (page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker). What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: AnkiDroid
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 2.20.0
    },
    {
      ID: 10,
      widget_type: View,
      text: 授予管理所有文件的权限,
      state: [
        checked
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 允许此应用读取、修改和删除此设备或任何已连接存储卷上的所有文件。如果您授予该权限，应用无需明确通知您即可访问文件。
    },
    {
      ID: 15,
      widget_type: View,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 所有文件访问权限
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Transitioned from the Introduction screen to the DeckPicker screen by touching the "开始" button, where the user checked the button for granting file management permissions.
2. Description of the current app state: The user is on the DeckPicker screen with a checked button for granting file management permissions and a new textview explaining the permission.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: The ManageSpace page is not yet reached, and the user may need to navigate further to access the ManageSpace functionality.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action would be to touch the widget with the text "所有文件访问权限" to explore further options or settings related to file access permissions.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
