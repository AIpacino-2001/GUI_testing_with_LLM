*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the ManageSpace page)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. I plan to touch the "ManageSpace" option to discover more about managing space in the AnkiDroid app. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "电话"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "开始"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Open the app again because the previous action led to closing the app

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to DeckPicker. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching on the button labeled "打开侧栏" in the DeckPicker screen, the current screen now displays additional buttons with resource IDs "button" and "fab_main," and new text views prompting to add cards using the "+" icon. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 打开侧栏,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: AnkiDroid
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      resource_id: button,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: ImageView,
      content_description: 更多选项,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 20,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      resource_id: fab_main,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 集合为空
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 开始添加卡牌[NEWLINE]使用 + 图标。
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched the "打开侧栏" button in the DeckPicker screen, which led to revealing additional buttons and text views related to managing decks in the AnkiDroid app.
2. Description of the current app state: The current screen in the DeckPicker page shows buttons with resource IDs "button" and "fab_main," along with text views prompting to add cards using the "+" icon.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Since the task is to open the ManageSpace page, the next step might involve navigating to a section related to managing space settings or storage in the app.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touch on the button with resource ID "button" as it may lead to accessing the ManageSpace page where space management settings are likely to be available.
