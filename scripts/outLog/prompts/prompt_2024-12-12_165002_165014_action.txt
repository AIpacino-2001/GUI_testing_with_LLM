*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button labeled "登录," the screen has transitioned from the "MyAccount" page to the "DeckPicker" page, where the interface now displays options for adding cards and managing collections. (page changed from MyAccount to DeckPicker). However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu have been somewhat relevant to the task, but there seems to be a deviation in reaching the ManageSpace page. fufu needs to explore the "ImageButton" with content_description "更多选项" to potentially find a direct path to the ManageSpace page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 打开侧栏,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: AnkiDroid
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      resource_id: button,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget button with resource_id button triggers a change in the screen content, replacing text and revealing new buttons upon touch interaction.
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: ImageView,
      content_description: 更多选项,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 集合为空
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 开始添加卡牌[NEWLINE]使用 + 图标。
    },
    {
      ID: 27,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      resource_id: fab_main,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated from the MyAccount page to the DeckPicker page by logging in successfully, but there was a deviation in reaching the ManageSpace page according to the criticizer's feedback.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page is DeckPicker, displaying options for adding cards and managing collections, including an "ImageButton" with content_description "更多选项."
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Explore the "ImageButton" with content_description "更多选项" to potentially find a direct path to the ManageSpace page as suggested by the criticizer.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The "ImageButton" with content_description "更多选项" might provide a direct path to the ManageSpace page, aligning with the task goal of opening the ManageSpace page.
