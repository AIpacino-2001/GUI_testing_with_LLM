*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "<1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>. <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "登录"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from DeckPicker to MyAccount. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:

*** User:

*** Assistant:

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the user has successfully filled in the password field with a new password "20080808" in the MyAccount screen. The password textfield is now focused and contains the updated password. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

  page_name: MyAccount,

  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: fufu has successfully filled in the email and password fields in the MyAccount screen.
2. Description of the current app state: The MyAccount page contains widgets for email and password textfields, along with login, reset password, registration, privacy, and forgot email address buttons.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: fufu needs to log in using the provided email and password to proceed to the ManageSpace page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The most logical action is to touch on the "登录" button to log in and progress towards the ManageSpace page.

*** User:
