*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the ManageSpace page)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. I plan to touch the "ManageSpace" option to discover more about managing space in the AnkiDroid app. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "电话"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button labeled "电话" on the previous screen, the current screen now displays new textviews with educational content and buttons for starting and syncing with AnkiWeb. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: Introduction,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 学得更少
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 记得更多
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: Anki 的卡片调度器通过增强你最薄弱的记忆和保存你最强大的记忆来节省时间
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 开始,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 15,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 从 AnkiWeb 同步,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched the "电话" button on the NexusLauncher page, which led to the display of educational content and buttons for starting and syncing with AnkiWeb on the Introduction page.

2. Description of the current app state: The Introduction page contains textviews with educational content and buttons labeled "开始" and "从 AnkiWeb 同步" for starting and syncing with AnkiWeb, respectively.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page, it seems necessary to navigate further into the app to find the specific option related to managing space.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action would be to touch the "开始" button to explore and proceed further into the app, as it might lead to additional options related to managing space.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
