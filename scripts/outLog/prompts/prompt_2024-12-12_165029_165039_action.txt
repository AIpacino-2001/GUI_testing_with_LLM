*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully navigates to the ManageSpace page)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "电话"

*** Assistant:

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from MyAccount to DeckPicker. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu have been somewhat relevant to the task, but there seems to be a deviation in reaching the ManageSpace page. fufu needs to explore the "ImageButton" with content_description "更多选项" to potentially find a direct path to the ManageSpace page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "更多选项"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, after touching the button with content_desc "更多选项," the DeckPicker screen now displays additional buttons such as "检查," "恢复备份," "笔记类型," "导入牌组," and "导出," along with popup messages that briefly appeared and disappeared. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 3,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 检查,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 8,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 恢复备份,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 12,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 笔记类型,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 16,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 导入牌组,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 20,
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 导出,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Open the AnkiDroid app's ManageSpace page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I explored the "更多选项" button and reached the DeckPicker screen with options like "检查," "恢复备份," "笔记类型," "导入牌组," and "导出."

2. Description of the current app state: The DeckPicker screen is displayed with options such as "检查," "恢复备份," "笔记类型," "导入牌组," and "导出."

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To reach the ManageSpace page, I may need to further explore the options available on the DeckPicker screen and potentially find a direct path to the ManageSpace page.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action would be to touch on the "检查" option to further explore its functionality and potentially find a path to the ManageSpace page.

*** User:
