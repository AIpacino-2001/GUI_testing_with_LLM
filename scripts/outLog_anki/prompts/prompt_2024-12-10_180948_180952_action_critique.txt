Current page: Permissions 
Widgets in current page:
```json
{
  page_name: Permissions,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: AnkiDroid 需要一些权限才能工作
    },
    {
      widget_type: FrameLayout,
      resource_id: all_files_permission,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0,
      children: [
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 所有文件访问权限
        },
        {
          widget_type: TextView,
          text: 将牌组集合保存在一个即使卸载了应用也不会被删除的安全所在
        },
        {
          widget_type: Switch,
          resource_id: switch_widget,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your choice step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Critique of task execution so far: <1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>
Need a workaround plan?: <yes/no, do not include any other word except "yes" or "no">
Workaround plan for fufu: <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>

*** Assistant:
Critique of task execution so far: The actions taken by fufu seem to be somewhat repetitive, touching the same widget multiple times without exploring other available options.

Need a workaround plan?: Yes

Workaround plan for fufu: fufu needs to explore the new widgets on the Permissions page that have not been interacted with yet to understand their roles and features.
