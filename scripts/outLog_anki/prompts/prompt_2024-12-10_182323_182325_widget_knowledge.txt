Past interactions on the widget:
- result of touch: By touching on the button with content description "保存," the screen transitioned from the CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes. The "保存" button is no longer visible, and new options for managing note types have appeared on the screen. (page changed from CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes)
- result of touch: By touching the button with content description "保存," the screen transitioned from the CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes. The button "保存" is no longer visible, and new text views and buttons related to managing note types are now present on the current screen. (page changed from CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes)

Describe the role and functionality of the widget briefly in one sentence based on the provided interaction history. Your answer should start with "The widget". If it seems that interacting the widget introduces a new page or widgets, try to include the name of the page or widgets in your answer. (e.g., The widget expands new options X, Y, Z, the widget opens a new page P, etc.) Do not include anything else except the description of the widget role in your answer.

The widget "保存" transitions the screen from CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes, revealing new options for managing note types.
