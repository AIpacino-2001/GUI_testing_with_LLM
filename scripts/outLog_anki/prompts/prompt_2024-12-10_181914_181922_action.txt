*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses the ModelFieldEditor page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Download"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching on the "Download" button, the previous screen's content related to general information and features has been replaced with specific download options for different platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, and iPhone/Android. Additionally, a testimonial and alternate download site option have been added to the current screen. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu have not directly led to accessing the "ModelFieldEditor" page for customizing card fields in AnkiDroid. fufu needs to explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page directly by looking for a button or menu option that specifically leads to that feature." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated through different pages and options on the AnkiDroid app but have not directly accessed the "ModelFieldEditor" page for customizing card fields as per the task requirement.

2. Description of the current app state: The current screen displays download options for Anki on different platforms, along with a testimonial and alternate download site options.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To access the "ModelFieldEditor" page, I need to navigate to a specific menu or button that leads to customization options for card fields.

4. Reasoning for the next action: Since the current screen does not provide direct access to the "ModelFieldEditor" page, I should explore the app further by looking for a menu or button related to card customization or field editing.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
