*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the ModelFieldEditor page to customize card fields. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses the ModelFieldEditor page and interacts with the customizable card fields)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "主页"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Apps"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Download"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, navigating back from the "SharedDecks" screen, the button with the content description "收起" has been replaced by a button with the content description "转到上一层级," and a new button with the content description "牌组搜索" has appeared. Additionally, a textview with the text "下载牌组" is now displayed on the screen. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken so far have not led fufu to the ModelFieldEditor page to customize card fields. fufu needs to explore the "转到上一层级" button to navigate to a different screen that might contain the ModelFieldEditor page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,

    },

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the ModelFieldEditor page to customize card fields.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Explored buttons "主页," "Apps," and "Download" but did not reach the ModelFieldEditor page as per the criticizer's feedback.
2. Description of the current app state: The current screen displays buttons "转到上一层级" and "牌组搜索," along with the text "下载牌组."
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Since the criticizer suggested exploring the "转到上一层级" button, the next step might involve navigating to a screen that could potentially lead to the ModelFieldEditor page.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touching the "转到上一层级" button is the most logical action to explore new screens and potentially find the ModelFieldEditor page.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
