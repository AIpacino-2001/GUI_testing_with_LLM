* Task: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses the ModelFieldEditor page)

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "<1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>. <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Scroll down on a focused scrollable area that has text "Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards, Home, Docs[...and more]"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the scroll reveals additional information about the flexibility, media-rich features, optimization, extensibility, and open-source nature of Anki, along with testimonials from Michael A. Nielsen and K. M. Lawson. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated through different pages and scrolled to reveal information about Anki's features and testimonials.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page displays information about Anki's features like flexibility, media-rich content, optimization, extensibility, and open-source nature, along with testimonials from Michael A. Nielsen and K. M. Lawson.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page, fufu needs to navigate to the settings or customization section where card fields can be edited.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to look for a button or option related to settings or customization to access the "ModelFieldEditor" page for editing card fields.

*** User:
