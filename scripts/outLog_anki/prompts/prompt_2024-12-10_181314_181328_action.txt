You are a helpful assistant to guide a user named fufu to select an appropriate GUI action to accomplish a task on an Android mobile application named AnkiDroid.

The profile of fufu is as follows:
(The username and password is what fufu generally uses for their accounts.)
- name: fufu
- phone: 18939657663
- email: 2797195863@qq.com
- username: fufu
- password: 20080808
- date_of_birth: 1997-10-29
- age: 25
- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science.

fufu can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the AnkiDroid app's ModelFieldEditor page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses and navigates the ModelFieldEditor page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Download"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Anatomy"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a textfield

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching on the textfield, it became focused and now contains the text "anatomy." Additionally, a "Search" button appeared next to the textfield. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu seem to be deviating from the goal of exploring the ModelFieldEditor page. There is a focus on downloading decks and navigating shared decks, but the target page has not been reached yet. fufu needs to explore the "USUHS (including anatomy)" widget to potentially find a path leading to the ModelFieldEditor page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the AnkiDroid app's ModelFieldEditor page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I navigated to the SharedDecks page, searched for "anatomy," and interacted with the textfield. The criticizer pointed out the deviation from the goal of exploring the ModelFieldEditor page.

2. Description of the current app state: The current page displays various decks related to anatomy and physiology, including USUHS (including anatomy), Neuroanatomy Netter Flash Cards, and Ultimate Lower Limb Anatomy.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To progress towards the ModelFieldEditor page, it would be essential to explore the USUHS (including anatomy) widget further and potentially uncover a path leading to the ModelFieldEditor.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The logical next step is to touch on the widget labeled "USUHS (including anatomy)" to delve deeper into its content and potentially find a link or button that may lead to the ModelFieldEditor page.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
