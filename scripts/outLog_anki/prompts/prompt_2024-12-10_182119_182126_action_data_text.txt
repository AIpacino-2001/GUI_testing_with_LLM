*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the ModelFieldEditor page to customize card fields. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses the ModelFieldEditor page and interacts with the customizable card fields)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "编辑卡片"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, upon touching the "编辑卡片" button, the screen transitioned from managing note types to the card template editor screen. The screen now displays options to save, preview, and access more settings for editing card templates, including toggling between front and back sides of the card. (page changed from ManageNotetypes to CardTemplateEditor). However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken so far have been appropriate, leading fufu to the CardTemplateEditor page effectively." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

  page_name: CardTemplateEditor,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,

          state: [
            selected

        },
        {

          widget_type: FrameLayout,

          possible_action_types: [
            touch

          num_prev_actions: 0

          resource_id: styling_edit,
          possible_action_types: [
            touch
          ],
          text: [
            样式
          ],
          num_prev_actions: 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the ModelFieldEditor page to customize card fields.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. I navigated from the ManageNotetypes page to the CardTemplateEditor page by touching the "编辑卡片" button successfully.
2. The current app state is on the CardTemplateEditor page where I can edit the card template with options to save, preview, and access more settings.
3. To customize card fields on the ModelFieldEditor page, I need to interact with the editable widget (EditText) to modify the card template content.
4. The next logical action is to fill in the editable widget (EditText) with the desired content to customize the card fields on the CardTemplateEditor page.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.

*** Assistant:
Role of the textfield: The EditText widget is used for inputting content related to the card template, specifically for customizing the front side of the card template.

Reasoning for generating fufu's text: fufu should input a personalized message for the front side of the card template based on their profile information.

Text: {{#标题}}<div>{{标题}}</div>{{/标题}}[NEWLINE]<div style="display: none">{{cloze:遮盖}}</div>[NEWLINE]<div id="err"></div>[NEWLINE]<div>Hi, I'm fufu, a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science.</div>
