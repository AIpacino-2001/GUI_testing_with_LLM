*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the AnkiDroid page to understand its features. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has interacted with various elements on the AnkiDroid page)

I'm currently on the NexusLauncher page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "AnkiDroid"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "开始"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to Permissions. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "switch_widget"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Introduction to Permissions. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu seem to be somewhat repetitive, touching the same widget multiple times without exploring other available options. fufu needs to explore the new widgets on the Permissions page that have not been interacted with yet to understand their roles and features." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "所有文件访问权限, 将牌组集合保存在一个即使卸载了应用也不会被删除的安全所在"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from Permissions to DeckPicker. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has resource_id "fab_main"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the "fab_main" button was already present on the previous screen but now appears again on the current screen after other buttons have been added. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: DeckPicker,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,

        touch

    {
      ID: 38,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      resource_id: fab_main,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget fab_main serves as a floating action button that remains present across screens to provide consistent access to a specific action or set of options.
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the AnkiDroid page to understand its features.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have interacted with various buttons on the DeckPicker page, including the "开始" button and the "所有文件访问权限" button. The criticizer pointed out the repetitive nature of my actions.

2. Description of the current app state: The DeckPicker page contains multiple widgets, including buttons for creating shared decks, filtered decks, and regular decks. The "fab_main" floating action button is present for accessing a specific action consistently.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To further explore the features of AnkiDroid, I need to interact with the buttons for creating shared decks, filtered decks, and regular decks to understand their functionalities.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action would be to touch on the button for creating a shared deck to explore its role and functionality in AnkiDroid.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
