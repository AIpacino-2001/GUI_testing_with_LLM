*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching on the button with text "0", the image displayed on the screen changed to "0.jpg (404×511)" in the current SharedDecks page. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 转到上一层级,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 下载牌组
    },
    {
      ID: 12,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: 主页,
      resource_id: home,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: 牌组搜索,
      resource_id: search,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: WebView,
      text: 0.jpg (404×511),
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      children: [
        {
          widget_type: Image,
          text: 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the AnkiDroid page to understand its features.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Explored SharedDecks page and interacted with various deck options including "Anatomy", "Biology", and "USUHS (including anatomy)".
2. Description of the current app state: The current page is SharedDecks displaying an image with the filename "0.jpg (404×511)".
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To further explore the features of AnkiDroid, it might be beneficial to interact with the "下载牌组" button or navigate back to the main page using the "主页" button.
4. Reasoning for the next action: To continue exploring the app's features, it would be logical to interact with the "下载牌组" button to understand the deck downloading functionality.
