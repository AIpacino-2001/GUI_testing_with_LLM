*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the Multimedia page to discover features related to multimedia content. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has interacted with at least one widget on the Multimedia page)

I'm currently on the CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor page. I plan to touch on the Multimedia widget to explore the Multimedia page and learn about its features. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "取消"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "取消" button, the screen has transitioned to a different editor view for card template browser appearance, containing options like "转到上一层级", "恢复初始设置", and "保存". The previous view with the prompt "还原默认值？" has changed to display settings related to card appearance customization. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 7,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 转到上一层级,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 浏览器外观
    },
    {
      ID: 10,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: 恢复初始设置,
      resource_id: action_restore_default,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 4,
      widget_role_inference: The widget prompts the user to confirm restoring default values when interacted with by displaying a new textview and 取消 and 确定 buttons for confirmation.
    },
    {
      ID: 11,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: 保存,
      resource_id: action_confirm,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 请输入卡牌浏览器用于显示您卡牌的模板。用此来显示更简洁的答案。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]一个前置模板[NEWLINE]“{{Country}} 的首都是：”[NEWLINE]可以被卡牌浏览器压缩为[NEWLINE]“首都：{{Country}}”
    },
    {
      ID: 17,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: 问题格式,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget is a textfield that displays the text 问题格式 and becomes focused for user input upon touch.
    },
    {
      ID: 20,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: 答案格式,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget is a textfield that allows for user input, with the initial indication of 答案格式 as a placeholder text.
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 保存卡牌模板时应用这些更改
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the Multimedia page to discover features related to multimedia content.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched the "取消" button on the CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor page, transitioning to a different editor view with options like "转到上一层级" and "恢复初始设置."

2. Description of the current app state: The current editor view contains options like "转到上一层级" and "恢复初始设置" along with text fields for entering card template formats.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Since the task is to explore the Multimedia page, the next step might involve navigating to a different section of the app related to multimedia content.

4. Reasoning for the next action: To explore multimedia features, the next logical action would be to touch on the "转到上一层级" button to potentially navigate to a different section of the app where multimedia content is accessible.
