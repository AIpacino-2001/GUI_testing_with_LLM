Task execution history so far (listed in chronological order):
===
18:22:43:CardTemplateEditor: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has content_desc "保存"
18:22:52:ManageNotetypes: [OBSERVATION] By touching the button with content description "保存," the screen transitioned from the CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes. The button "保存" is no longer visible, and new text views and buttons related to managing note types are now present on the current screen. (page changed from CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes)
18:23:00:ManageNotetypes: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has content_desc "搜索"
18:23:08:ManageNotetypes: [OBSERVATION] By touching the "搜索" button, the button with content_desc "搜索" was replaced with a button labeled "收起" and a focused button for searching.
18:23:16:ManageNotetypes: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has text "编辑卡片"
18:23:25:CardTemplateEditor: [OBSERVATION] After touching the button "编辑卡片" on the previous screen "ManageNotetypes", the current screen "CardTemplateEditor" shows additional options such as "保存", "预览", and "更多选项" for editing the card template. The screen now displays fields for editing the front and back of the card template. (page changed from ManageNotetypes to CardTemplateEditor)
18:23:30:CardTemplateEditor: [ACTION] fufu touched on a button that has content_desc "更多选项"
18:23:38:CardTemplateEditor: [OBSERVATION] After touching the button with content_desc "更多选项", the screen has changed to include new buttons with text "卡片浏览器外观," "插入字段," and "以 Markdown 格式复制."

Current page: CardTemplateEditor 
Widgets in current page:
```json
{
  page_name: CardTemplateEditor,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 卡片浏览器外观,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 插入字段,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: LinearLayout,
      text: 以 Markdown 格式复制,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```
Guideline for criticizing the actions:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary, the widget has not been interacted yet.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore the new widgets that have not been used and doesn't know the role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

I am going to provide a template for your output to reason about your choice step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
Critique of task execution so far: <1~2 sentences in one line, say "okay" if everything seems fine.>
Need a workaround plan?: <yes/no, do not include any other word except "yes" or "no">
Workaround plan for fufu: <Start with "fufu needs to", and describe in one line. Say just "none" if fufu is doing well and no workaround is needed.>

*** Assistant:
Critique of task execution so far: The actions taken by fufu seem to be leading away from the initial task of exploring the ManageNotetypes page.

Need a workaround plan?: yes

Workaround plan for fufu: fufu needs to explore the widgets related to managing note types on the ManageNotetypes page.
