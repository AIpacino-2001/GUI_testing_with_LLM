*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the ManageNotetypes page to learn about managing note types. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has interacted with key widgets on the ManageNotetypes page)

I'm currently on the CardTemplateEditor page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "保存"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from CardTemplateEditor to ManageNotetypes. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "搜索"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "编辑卡片"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from ManageNotetypes to CardTemplateEditor. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "更多选项"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu seem to be leading away from the initial task of exploring the ManageNotetypes page. fufu needs to explore the widgets related to managing note types on the ManageNotetypes page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "卡片浏览器外观"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. The page changed from CardTemplateEditor to CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a textfield that has text "问题格式"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "恢复初始设置"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, the button with the content description "恢复初始设置" has been replaced with a textview asking to restore default values, accompanied by "取消" and "确定" buttons for confirmation. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor,
  children: [
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 还原默认值？
    },
    {
      ID: 13,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 取消,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      ID: 14,
      widget_type: Button,
      text: 确定,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the ManageNotetypes page to learn about managing note types.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I have navigated to the CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor page and interacted with the "恢复初始设置" button, which led to a confirmation prompt with "取消" and "确定" buttons.

2. Description of the current app state: The current page is the CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor page displaying a prompt with the text "还原默认值？" along with "取消" and "确定" buttons for confirmation.

3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To explore the ManageNotetypes page for managing note types, it seems necessary to cancel the restoration of default values before proceeding with further exploration.

4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action is to touch on the "取消" button to cancel the restoration of default values and continue exploring the ManageNotetypes page for managing note types.
