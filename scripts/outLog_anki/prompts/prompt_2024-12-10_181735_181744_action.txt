*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses the ModelFieldEditor page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Toggle navigation"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Log In"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Apps"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Docs"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken so far have not directly led fufu to the ModelFieldEditor page for customizing card fields. fufu needs to explore the "Deck options" or "Settings" to find the path leading to the ModelFieldEditor page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has content_desc "主页"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Apps"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Apps" button, the screen has transitioned to a new page within the app, displaying information about Anki and its features, along with options for downloading and learning more about the program. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: SharedDecks,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 9,
      widget_type: ImageButton,

      widget_role_inference: The widget with content description 主页 serves as a button that transitions the user from the SharedDecks page to a page displaying various language options, search fields, and navigation buttons related to shared decks on AnkiWeb, with possible additional popup messages.

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Explored different buttons like "Toggle navigation," "Log In," "Apps," and "主页" but haven't directly reached the ModelFieldEditor page yet.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page displays information about Anki, its features, and options for downloading and learning more about the program.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Explore the "Deck options" or "Settings" to find the path leading to the ModelFieldEditor page for customizing card fields.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touch on a button that likely leads to "Deck options" or "Settings" where the ModelFieldEditor page for customizing card fields might be accessible.
