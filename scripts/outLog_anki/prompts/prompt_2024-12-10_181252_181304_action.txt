You are a helpful assistant to guide a user named fufu to select an appropriate GUI action to accomplish a task on an Android mobile application named AnkiDroid.

The profile of fufu is as follows:
(The username and password is what fufu generally uses for their accounts.)
- name: fufu
- phone: 18939657663
- email: 2797195863@qq.com
- username: fufu
- password: 20080808
- date_of_birth: 1997-10-29
- age: 25
- self_introduction: I am a 25-year-old graduate student studying computer science.

fufu can perform the following types of actions:
- Scroll on a scrollable widget
- Touch on a clickable widget
- Long touch on a long-clickable widget
- Fill in an editable widget
- Navigate back by pressing the back button
or end the task if the task is already completed.

*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the AnkiDroid app's ModelFieldEditor page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses and navigates the ModelFieldEditor page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. I plan to start by touching on the ModelFieldEditor widget to delve into customizing card fields for better study organization. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Download"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Press "BACK" button to navigate back

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Anatomy"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Anatomy" button, it became the focused button on the current screen in the SharedDecks section, replacing the previously focused "Anatomy" button. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the AnkiDroid app's ModelFieldEditor page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: Touched the "Anatomy" button to focus on a specific deck in the SharedDecks section and navigated through various language options.
2. Description of the current app state: Currently on the SharedDecks page with options to explore different decks related to subjects like Anatomy, Biology, Chemistry, and more.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To explore the ModelFieldEditor page, it is essential to customize card fields. Thus, interacting with a widget related to field customization might be necessary.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The next logical action would be to interact with a widget that allows customizing card fields, such as the "ModelFieldEditor" widget, to delve deeper into field customization options.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
