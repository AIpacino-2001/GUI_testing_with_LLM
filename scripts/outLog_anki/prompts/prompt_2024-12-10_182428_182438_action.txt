*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the ManageNotetypes page to learn about managing note types. (The task is known to be completed when fufu has interacted with key widgets on the ManageNotetypes page)

I'm currently on the CardTemplateEditor page. What should be the first action?

Touch on a button that has content_desc "保存"

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "取消"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button with the text "取消," the screen has transitioned to a new page with additional buttons for navigation, a text view for browser appearance, and text fields for card template customization. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken so far seem okay, with fufu exploring various options within the app related to managing note types." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json
{
  page_name: CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor,
  children: [
    {
      ID: 7,
      widget_type: ImageButton,
      content_description: 转到上一层级,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 浏览器外观
    },
    {
      ID: 10,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: 恢复初始设置,
      resource_id: action_restore_default,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget allows the user to restore default settings by confirming with 取消 and 确定 buttons after interacting with the button labeled 恢复初始设置.
    },
    {
      ID: 11,
      widget_type: Button,
      content_description: 保存,
      resource_id: action_confirm,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 请输入卡牌浏览器用于显示您卡牌的模板。用此来显示更简洁的答案。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]一个前置模板[NEWLINE]“{{Country}} 的首都是：”[NEWLINE]可以被卡牌浏览器压缩为[NEWLINE]“首都：{{Country}}”
    },
    {
      ID: 17,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: 问题格式,
      state: [
        focused
      ],
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 2,
      widget_role_inference: The widget is a textfield that displays the text 问题格式 and becomes focused for user input upon touch interaction.
    },
    {
      ID: 20,
      widget_type: EditText,
      text: 答案格式,
      possible_action_types: [
        touch,
        long_touch,
        set_text
      ],
      num_prev_actions: 0
    },
    {
      widget_type: TextView,
      text: 保存卡牌模板时应用这些更改
    }
  ]
}
```

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the ManageNotetypes page to learn about managing note types.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: fufu has been exploring various options within the app related to managing note types, including interacting with buttons for customization and settings.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page is CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor with options for customizing card templates and browser appearance.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: To further explore managing note types, fufu may need to interact with the text fields for card template customization or navigate back to access more options.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Since the text field for "答案格式" has not been interacted with yet, the next logical action would be to touch on the text field to explore the customization options for managing note types.
