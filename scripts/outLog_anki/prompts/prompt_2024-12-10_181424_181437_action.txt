*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the AnkiDroid app's ModelFieldEditor page. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses and navigates the ModelFieldEditor page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Download"

*** User:

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Download"

*** User:
I performed the action you suggested. What should be the next action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "2,  other item(s)"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button with the text "2, other item(s)", the screen now displays additional shared decks related to USUHS, including Anatomy and Pre-Clerkship, along with options for Apps, About, Support, Terms, and Privacy. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu seem to be focused on navigating through different sections of the app but have not directly led to accessing the ModelFieldEditor page. fufu needs to explore the "USUHS SOM Anatomy" and "USUHS SOM Pre-Clerkship" widgets, as they could potentially lead to the ModelFieldEditor page." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the AnkiDroid app's ModelFieldEditor page.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
1. In the previous interactions, fufu has navigated through different sections of the app but has not directly accessed the ModelFieldEditor page as per the criticizer's feedback.

2. The current app state shows additional shared decks related to USUHS, including Anatomy and Pre-Clerkship, along with options for Apps, About, Support, Terms, and Privacy.

3. To complete the task of exploring the ModelFieldEditor page, fufu should now interact with the widget related to "USUHS SOM Anatomy" or "USUHS SOM Pre-Clerkship" to potentially progress towards accessing the ModelFieldEditor page.

4. The next logical action is to touch on the widget related to "USUHS SOM Anatomy" or "USUHS SOM Pre-Clerkship" to explore further towards the ModelFieldEditor page.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
