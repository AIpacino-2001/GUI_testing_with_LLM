Past interactions on the widget:
- result of touch: The button with the content description "恢复初始设置" has been replaced with a textview asking to restore default values, accompanied by "取消" and "确定" buttons for confirmation.
- result of touch: By touching the button with content_desc "恢复初始设置," the screen now shows a new textview with the text "还原默认值？" and two buttons with the text "取消" and "确定."
