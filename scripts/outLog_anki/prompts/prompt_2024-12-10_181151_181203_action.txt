I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the button with content description "主页," the screen has transitioned from the "SharedDecks" page to a page displaying various language options, search fields, and navigation buttons related to shared decks on AnkiWeb. However, I got the following critique for my actions so far: 
> Criticizer: "The actions taken by fufu have been quite effective in exploring various features of the AnkiDroid app." 
Considering the critique, what should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the AnkiDroid page to understand its features.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: fufu has navigated through the SharedDecks page, exploring various language options and decks such as Anatomy, Biology, and USUHS.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page displays language options, search fields, and navigation buttons related to shared decks on AnkiWeb.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Explore additional deck categories or access information regarding apps, about, support, terms, and privacy.
4. Reasoning for the next action: The logical next action would be to touch on a button related to apps, about, support, terms, or privacy to further explore the features and information available on the AnkiDroid app.

*** User:
