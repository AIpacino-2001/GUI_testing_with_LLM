*** User:
My name is fufu and I am using an application named AnkiDroid to accomplish the following task: 
* Task: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience. (The task is known to be completed when fufu successfully accesses the ModelFieldEditor page)

I'm currently on the SharedDecks page. I plan to touch on the "ModelFieldEditor" button to enter the page where I can customize card fields for a more personalized studying experience. What should be the first action?

*** Assistant:
Touch on a button that has text "Toggle navigation"

*** User:
I performed the action, and as a result, by touching the "Toggle navigation" button, the screen now displays additional options for logging in and signing up, along with a focused button for toggling navigation. The layout has been updated to provide more interactive elements for the user. What should be the next action?

This time, I'll give you the full content of the current page as follows (I organized the page content as a hierarchical structure):
```json

Guideline for selecting the next action:
- Note that `num_prev_actions` property means the number of times the widget has been interacted with so far.
- Note that `widget_role_inference` property means the role of the widget inferred by previous actions. Use this property to infer what the widget is used for. If the widget has not been interacted yet, `widget_role_inference` property is not included in the widget dictionary.
- When I am stuck, you might guide me to explore a new widget that has not been used and I don't know its role yet.
- I don't want to do the same actions repeatedly except it is clearly needed for the task (e.g., navigating back to the first page of the app), so guide me to perform effective actions to complete the task.

Recall that my current task is: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page to customize card fields for a personalized AnkiDroid experience.
Select the next suitable action to perform, or end the task if the task is already completed.

This time, I am going to provide a template for your output to let you think about my next action step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Do not include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template. Preserve the formatting and overall template.

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Reflect criticizer's feedback if I mentioned any. Be careful not to include any actions that haven't been performed yet>
2. Description of the current app state: <1~2 sentences, briefly describe in one line according to the hierarchical structure I provided above>
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: <1~2 sentences according to the task execution history and current app state. Do not immediately judge the next action here>
4. Reasoning for the next action: <1 sentence reasoning the most logical action to take next on the current state (or justification for ending the task). Refer to the guideline above>

*** Assistant:
=== Below is the template for your answer ===
1. Summary of my previous interactions for the task: I touched the "Toggle navigation" button on the SharedDecks page, which revealed options for logging in and signing up.
2. Description of the current app state: The current page displays options for logging in and signing up, along with the "Toggle navigation" button.
3. Inference on the remaining steps needed to complete the task: Explore the "ModelFieldEditor" page by interacting with the available options related to customizing card fields.
4. Reasoning for the next action: Touch on the "Log In" or "Sign Up" button to further navigate through the options and potentially access the "ModelFieldEditor" page for customizing card fields.

*** User:
Based on your reasoning, select the next action or end the task by calling one of the given function that corresponds to a specific action.
